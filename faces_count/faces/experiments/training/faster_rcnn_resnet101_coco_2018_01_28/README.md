I have used used pretrained faster rcnn resnet101 model on coco dataset and trained from scratch on my dataset.

Downloaded required model from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md 

or 

click link to download faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco model - http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz

untar and keep the folder contained files here and this folder path need to be mentioned in config file to train the model.
